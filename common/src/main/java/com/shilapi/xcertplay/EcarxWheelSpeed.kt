/**
 * Wheel speed and gear from the ECARX car SDK (`ISensor`), for the iPhone's dead reckoning. The SDK is
 * in the head unit's boot classpath, so it is reached by reflection; an ordinary app reads these
 * sensors with no extra permission (Geely Monjaro, ECARX KX11, Android 9).
 *
 * The speed is polled rather than subscribed to: a listener only fires on a change, so a standing car
 * would send nothing, and the iPhone should hear 0 m/s at a red light. Its raw value is taken as m/s:
 * the Monjaro tweak app MConfig+ shows raw x 3.72 as the cluster's km/h, and clusters read about 3 %
 * over the true speed.
