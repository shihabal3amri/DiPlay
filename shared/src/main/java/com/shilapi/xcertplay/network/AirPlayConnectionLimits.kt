/**
 * Bounds the control connections the AirPlay listener keeps open, in total and per peer.
 * At a cap an unverified connection older than [graceMillis] is dropped first, so idle sockets cannot keep a
 * new peer out. At the total cap the victim comes from the peer that holds the most connections.
 * Without such a connection the oldest verified connection from the requester's exact address is dropped.
 * A phone that vanished without a reset leaves one behind, and must not lock itself out. Another address in
 * the same IPv6 prefix cannot drop it. A younger connection, or a verified
 * connection of another peer, is never dropped: the new connection is refused instead.
